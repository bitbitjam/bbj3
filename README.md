## Revenge of the Killer Princesses - Paul Robson (VIP)

![title](/[VIP]%20revenge/ingame.jpg?raw=true)

If you've ever played Phantom Slayer on the Dragon/Coco, it's a bit like that with Princesses. You explore a maze full of fairly lethal princesses, and have a gun with a very slow recharge (so you can't just wade in to them DOOM style)

This game is an RPG typing game that was made for BITBITJam3
It was made completely by one person using Qbasic for MS-DOS.
It has been designed to run on a IBM XT 286 with CGA Graphics and 256k of RAM.
As I do not have a 286, I have tested this with DOSBox with the graphics set to CGA and the cycles turned down to 600.

## Paintress - Frodewin (GB)

![img](/[C64]%20Paintress/gameover.jpg?raw=true) ![img](/[C64]%20Paintress/ingame.jpg?raw=true)

You are a princess, but even so you sometimes have to do the dirty work. The mad king orders to go to the dungeon and repaint it... with the blood of the monsters there!

This is a C64 game (yes, for that old but good Commodore machine!) made for bitbitjam3 in 2016. It plays in the web player from Gamejolt, but very slow. To get a more genuine feeling, I recommend downloading the PRG file and playing it with the VICE emulator.

You are little Timmy. Be a good boy and pay attention to mom's advice. Exceed level 4 and get your reward. Be smart, you are the slowest thing out there, learn how to use boats to your advantage. It may be challenging sometimes, don't give up!

Almost every code is written from scratch. Some graphics are ripped off and others created by my and. No music at all. Enjoy!

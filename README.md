## Revenge of the Killer Princesses - Paul Robson (VIP)

![title](/[VIP]%20revenge/ingame.jpg?raw=true)

If you've ever played Phantom Slayer on the Dragon/Coco, it's a bit like that with Princesses. You explore a maze full of fairly lethal princesses, and have a gun with a very slow recharge (so you can't just wade in to them DOOM style)

This game is an RPG typing game that was made for BITBITJam3
It was made completely by one person using Qbasic for MS-DOS.
It has been designed to run on a IBM XT 286 with CGA Graphics and 256k of RAM.
As I do not have a 286, I have tested this with DOSBox with the graphics set to CGA and the cycles turned down to 600.

## Paintress - Frodewin (GB)

![img](/[C64]%20Paintress/gameover.jpg?raw=true) ![img](/[C64]%20Paintress/ingame.jpg?raw=true)

You are a princess, but even so you sometimes have to do the dirty work. The mad king orders to go to the dungeon and repaint it... with the blood of the monsters there!

This is a C64 game (yes, for that old but good Commodore machine!) made for bitbitjam3 in 2016. It plays in the web player from Gamejolt, but very slow. To get a more genuine feeling, I recommend downloading the PRG file and playing it with the VICE emulator.

## The Faerie Princess - Videlais (GB)

![img](/[GB]%20The%20Faerie%20Princess/ingame.jpg?raw=true)

Primarily, other than introductory text, it is a boss battle against a dragon. Get four spear-throws against it and you win. However, allow four fireballs to hurt you, and it's game over for both you and the princess.

Based very loosely on the story of Saint George and the Dragon, but, you know, swapping in a princess instead of Saint George.

## Drakaina - Claire & Pilo (NES)

![img](/[NES]%20Drakaina/title.jpg?raw=true) ![img](/[NES]%20Drakaina/ingame.jpg?raw=true)

It might have been a little too much to learn in only one week.
The game does have a vertical scroll, but not fully working (palette not working, so the game looks crappy...), no sound or music (this is the worst in my opinion, planned to do it with famitone2 lib and famitracker). The graphics are not so good because we found out quite late what would be possible to do, and what wouldn't. Obviously not so much was possible with current code :)
Although it was very fun to do, we are quite disappointed with what came out.

Maybe we will try to improve it, after the jam has ended.

Developer's thoughs.
...............................................................................
   Well, my friend EN.i is already asleep so I'll have to suffice you with 
anecdotes, heh. Being frank, I was hoping this to be more of a challenge 
because of my C language ineptitude, but nope! I even feel more confident
with my skillz! (not that much because I took a peek to some other contestants
coding and it's absolutely bonkers how cool they code! "orz).

   But anyway, EN.i and I died several times this week. Either managing to work
backgrounds, or trying to get music and sound (for some reason the SPC module
LOVES to crash!). In the end, we had to limit ourselves quite a lot because
of time constraints and overall stress HA! My back hurts because of it.

   It's sad that the library we were using has not seen any update since 2014,
so there's that, also there is no community of it as far as we two know. But
nevertheless, it was quite a lot of fun doing this, even with a thing with
zero backup. I hope this revives, C programming for SNES seems like a good 
idea to me. C is fun and more accessible than assembly, of which I know close
to -65536.

   En fin! Whatever! Have fun with this game, hopefully as much fun as we had 
doing it. And maaaaaybe in a distant future we could think about either 
expanding this, or due to lack of masochism remaking this game in anything 
else. Even Genesis or GBC seem like a better idea! I'm sorry SNES, my one and 
only love.

All Hail SNES! Hasta la vista!
By the way, our native is Spanish so expect some Broken-English. :'D

                        COMPILING HILDA
						
In order to compile the game (whatever the reason you have), you must set 
things up for PVsneslib.
Documentation is kind of scarce, but most of how to set it up is in this wiki:
	http://www.portabledev.com/wiki/doku.php?id=installation_en
Any other documentation you have is included with PVSneslib itself as a 
Doxygen documentation (that thing that generates docs from your code and some
tags). Keep it close!
	
Please take into consideration that following the steps in the wiki you'll 
encounter two major problems:
	-The links for downloading PVsneslib, devkitsnes and the examples are down.
	Fortunately you can download a newer version than the one in that place 
	from this other link: https://github.com/nArnoSNES/pvsneslib
	-By following the steps in the tutorial, you'll not be able to compile 
	anything. I suggest you use any of the examples in the snes-examples folder
	as a template instead of the one provided by the PVsneslib library.

Overall with these two things you should be ready to go! Remember to check the
directories at the first lines of your Makefile, and yeah! Good luck!

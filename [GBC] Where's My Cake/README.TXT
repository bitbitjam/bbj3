"License"
---------
This source code has been made available for educational, non-commercial use only!

If you're new to gbdev, maybe you can pick it apart and learn something, but I doubt it ;)
Don't use any of it in your project--it's poor, messy, rushed code anyway!
Instead, experiment and write new code yourself! 
The only way to improve is through practice, not copy+pasting ;)





How to build the source?
------------------------
If you have gbdk installed and are using Windows,
you can just the included make.bat





#bitbitjam3 Thoughts
--------------------
This has been a very busy week. 
As usual, time was an issue. 
Many things got cut. 
The whole project is held together 
with virtual duct tape and band-aids.
In the end, something new is released.
I hope somebody out there enjoys it!!
Thanks for having a look!

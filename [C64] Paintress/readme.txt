This is a game made in one week for #bitbitjam3, a game jam for old hardware. The theme of the game jam was "Red Hot Princess Carnage", I did my best to reflect the theme within the game. I used to program on a real C64 (or rather a real C128) back in the days, but this is my first larger project since 20 years. It was awesome, thanks to #bitbitjam3 for making this game jam.

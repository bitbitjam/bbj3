Princess Red Keyboard Karnage Warrior
(C) 2016 demiO2

This game is an RPG typing game that was made for BITBITJam3
It was made completely by one person using Qbasic for MS-DOS.
It has been designed to run on a IBM XT 286 with CGA Graphics and 256k of RAM.
As I do not have a 286, I have tested this with DOSBox with the graphics set
to CGA and the cycles turned down to 600.  It may even run on an original
IBM PC or PC-JR, but I have no way of testing it.

There may be bugs, or errors, but this was made in about 18 hours of time
from start to finish, so please bear with me.
This is my first graphical game completely written for DOS and it probably
shows. :)

Instructions

On the overworld, control Red with the arrow keys. Collect various items
and use them by walking into things. Doors, NPCs etc.
Occasionally (depending on the difficulty) a Keyboard Kombat screen will 
appear.  This is the combat section of the game. Just type the words that
appear on the screen and try not to make mistakes.
for added fun, if you type O and P on the overworld, it will change the
cOlor and Palette respectively.  It's kind of fun to play with.
Enjoy the game and let me know what you think of it!  Thanks!

echo This game is an RPG typing game that was made for BITBITJam3
echo It was made completely by one person using Qbasic for MS-DOS.
echo It has been designed to run on a IBM XT 286 with CGA Graphics and 256k of RAM.
echo As I do not have a 286, I have tested this with DOSBox with the graphics set
echo to CGA and the cycles turned down to 600.  It may even run on an original
echo IBM PC or PC-JR, but I have no way of testing it.
echo There may be bugs, or errors, but this was made in about 18 hours of time
echo from start to finish, so please bear with me.
echo This is my first graphical game completely written for DOS and it probably
echo shows. :)
echo Please feel free to distribute this game freely and if you like it

Echo Instructions
echo On the overworld, control Red with the arrow keys. Collect various items
echo and use them by walking into things. Doors, NPCs etc.
echo Occasionally (depending on the difficulty) a Keyboard Kombat screen will 
echo appear.  This is the combat section of the game. Just type the words that
echo appear on the screen and try not to make mistakes.
echo for added fun, if you type O and P on the overworld, it will change the
echo cOlor and Palette respectively.  It's kind of fun to play with.
echo Enjoy the game and let me know what you think of it!  Thanks!

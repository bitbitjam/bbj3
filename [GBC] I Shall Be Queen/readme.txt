A double dragon-style beat-em-up for #bitbitjam3 For the gameboy and gameboy colour!

Not sure if the source code went on there so I've uploaded it to:

For your perusal.

Err, controls... yeah, A to Jump, B to attack, SELECT to use mana, Good luck!

There are a couple of bugs with the game and it gets bloody tough to beat.

Also I had to cut out the boss fight due to ROM and time limitations.

There's a few easter eggs dotted around, have fun!

All code and graphics and sfx created by me Ryan Carson, follow me on the twitters for more gameboy love ;) @refreshgamesuk

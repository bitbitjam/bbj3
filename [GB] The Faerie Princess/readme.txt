An entry for #bitbitjam3, this is a Game Boy game -- and so you will need an emulator to play it -- based very loosely on the story of Saint George and the Dragon, but, you know, swapping in a princess instead of Saint George.

Primarily, other than introductory text, it is a boss battle against a dragon. Get four spear-throws against it and you win. However, allow four fireballs to hurt you, and it's game over for both you and the princess.

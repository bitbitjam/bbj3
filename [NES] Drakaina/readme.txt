This is the NTSC NES rom for game Drakaina, created in one week using cc65  for the bitbitjam#3.

Source code can be found at https://github.com/piloChambert/nesProject.

It might have been a little too much to learn in only one week.
The game does have a vertical scroll, but not fully working (palette not working, so the game looks crappy...), no sound or music (this is the worst in my opinion, planned to do it with famitone2 lib and famitracker). The graphics are not so good because we found out quite late what would be possible to do, and what wouldn't. Obviously not so much was possible with current code :)
Although it was very fun to do, we are quite disappointed with what came out.

Maybe we will try to improve it, after the jam has ended.

The source code is not well commented, and I don't think it should be used as an example ;) (very poorly optimized, buggy and glitchy, and might not work on an actual NES).
